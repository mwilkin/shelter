    <h2>Welcome to Fuzzy Buddies Animal Shelter!</h2>

    <p>We have four awesome animals looking for a home with you!</p>

    <p><img src="img/kelpie.jpg">
      Buddy is an Australian Kelpie with boundless energy and a can-do attitude! He also smells kind of weird, but we're told by his previous owner that he can fetch beer out of the fridge.

      It's a wrap!  Mutton Chop would fit right in at your home.
